# QuizCreator
An old project for a maths worksheet generator. This was originally a project that had commercial intentions, but the market for paid quizzes was too competitive - but feel free to use this if you are an educator or want to learn about Python Docx. Warning: Messy codebase - this was before I learned to write readable, scalable code.
